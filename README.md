# Emacs Dev Kit

## About

The Emacs Dev Kit is a set of customizations and extensions for the latest GNU Emacs
(currently 23.2) designed to improve the development experience on Emacs and make it
more competitive to the modern IDEs. Sure, I know that Emacs is the greatest, but many people
don't and I hope this powerful setup will make believers out of them as well.

I have borrowed the idea from technomancy's Emacs Starter Kit, but pushed it to the next level.

## Enhanced support

EDK features enhanced support for the following programming languages:
    * Ruby
    * Lisp/Scheme/Clojure
    * Perl
    * Python
    * Java
    * Scala

I'll try add more stuff along the way
